# Introduction

Research writing is increasingly a team effort; often multiple people contribute to different manuscript parts. This follows corrections, additions and revisions at different stages. So, a version control system like `git` could simplify the process at many levels.

This documentation aims to provide a brief yet complete account of integrating LaTex with Git. In addition, when the project is integrated with [github](https://github.com/), it provides seamless collaboration and cloud-syncing.

## Outline

There are three parts to the documentation. Part one focuses on introduction to LaTeX and its installation. The second part focuses on preparing a manuscript with LaTeX. It introduces the preamble, sections and other options in detail. The final part discusses the integration of LaTeX with Git and Github. A template file is available within this repository, and you can use it from the header link.
