# Installation

Most often people ditch LaTeX for difficulty in debugging the errors. And, the errors are primarily arise either from a missing style file or from the usage of special characters. We will discuss later in this documentation about the usage of special characters like `\` and `$` in LaTeX. However, my personal choice to avoid the first error is to install the complete package.

## Acquiring an ISO file

The complete installation can be done by downloading the `texlive` ISO file from [Tex Users Group (TUG) site](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html). It is big about 3-4 GB, would take some time to download and install. However, it is worth to wait the time.

Once downloaded, in linux, right-click the file and mount as a directory. In latest windows (10 & 11) double click the file should mount the file as virtual drive. For older windows, extra software like [wincdemu](https://wincdemu.sysprogs.org/) is required to mount the file as drive.

## Installing the package

In linux, open terminal in the texlive directory and issue the command `./install-tl`. For windows double click the `install-tl-windows.bat` and this should open up the installation window.

Usually the default settings are enough. However, please make sure to create symlinks so that the package can be accessed system-wide.

[How this can be done?]

Another, optional tweak is to de-select unwanted language packages. This should save considerable space.

After this, press `y` to continue the installation and wait for sometime to complete the process. Once finished, open the terminal (or powershell) and then type `pdflatex --version`. If you got something like this, ensures the proper installation of texlive package in your system.
