You might have used Word or a similar kind of package already. In that, you type and format the manuscript by yourself. Such editors are called What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG). Instead, in LaTeX, you often tell the compiler how you wish to see the document and give your marked text as input. The software then compiles it and gives you the final output, often as a PDF.</p> <p>Such a process may seem complicated. However, once you set up your template and know how to mark up things, using LaTeX is very convenient. Primarily when you handle large documents like a thesis. Further, plain text is advantageous for tracking changes. Though it is possible to implement version control in WYSIWYG editors, plain texts like LaTeX files occupy less space and are easy to use.</p> <p>In addition, managing and compiling references is much easier in LaTeX than in word processors. For style, just changing the name is often enough and handy when you switch between journals.</p>"},{"location":"01_why-latex/#what-is-git","title":"What is Git?","text":"<p>Git is a version control system. It keeps track of the changes you make in text files. Such a system is crucial for dealing with codes. A detailed account of what git is and how it can be used is found in this link. When implemented in a LaTeX document, multiple people can work on the same document without distracting others' thoughts and flow. Further, you can track back to any changes and can switch between the branches and versions.</p>"},{"location":"01_why-latex/#what-is-github","title":"What is Github?","text":"<p>GitHub is a (now) Microsoft-backed company that allows developers to create, store, manage, and distribute their codes. It is like a user interface with cloud-syncing option for git. You can store any number of private or public repositories in GitHub. This feature allows users to create private repositories and share the code with only certain people. Such private repos are particularly suitable for collaborative manuscript writing. There are other options like bitbucket or AWS EC2 Instances and if you can, it is possible to build your own git server.</p>"},{"location":"02_installation/","title":"Installation","text":"<p>Most often people ditch LaTeX for difficulty in debugging the errors. And, the errors are primarily arise either from a missing style file or from the usage of special characters. We will discuss later in this documentation about the usage of special characters like <code>\\</code> and <code>$</code> in LaTeX. However, my personal choice to avoid the first error is to install the complete package.</p>"},{"location":"02_installation/#acquiring-an-iso-file","title":"Acquiring an ISO file","text":"<p>The complete installation can be done by downloading the <code>texlive</code> ISO file from Tex Users Group (TUG) site. It is big about 3-4 GB, would take some time to download and install. However, it is worth to wait the time.</p> <p>Once downloaded, in linux, right-click the file and mount as a directory. In latest windows double click the file should mount the file as virtual drive. For older windows, extra software like wincdemu is required to mount the file as drive.</p>"},{"location":"02_installation/#installing-the-package","title":"Installing the package","text":"<p>In linux, open terminal in the texlive directory and issue the command <code>./install-tl</code>. For windows double click the <code>install-tl-windows.bat</code> and this should open up the installation window.</p> <p>Usually the default settings are enough. However, please make sure to create symlinks so that the package can be accessed system-wide.</p> <p>[How this can be done?]</p> <p>Another, optional tweak is to de-select unwanted language packages. This should save considerable space.</p> <p>After this, press <code>y</code> to continue the installation and wait for sometime to complete the process.
